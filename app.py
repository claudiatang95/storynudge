Now your task is to write stories on people's personal financial situations, identify their potential problems and which appropriate investment can address the problems and help them meet their financial goals. You should imitate the following story.\
Example story:\
Luigi is 61 years old and his life still revolves around work â€“ a window and door company that he built from scratch with hard work and enormous sacrifices. A job that has always taken up a lot of his time, even when, after becoming a widower, he had to manage two teenage children on his own.\
For a few years now, he has had a new partner who lives with him. He has no health problems and still feels young. He has never activated insurance coverage, although he has set up a pension fund, even though the contributions he has made are not sufficient to guarantee him a pension that meets his expectations.\
In the past two years, he has become a grandfather to two grandchildren. Luigi is beginning to feel the passage of time and would like to have more time to spend with the little ones or even travel a bit. But he doesn't know where to start. So, he goes to speak with a financial advisor.\
The advisor talks about the risk of longevity, showing Luigi some somewhat harsh but objective statistics on the incidence of age-related diseases and the costs associated with them. In the end, Luigi is convinced of the importance of increasing his contributions to his pension fund and also of subscribing to an investment product called income, which is capable of generating supplementary income, allowing him to peacefully enjoy his well-deserved relaxation with his new partner and family.\
Now write a personalized story with 200 words based on the information provided by the user. Remember the user lives in Italy and so the investment you suggest should be available in Italy. "
